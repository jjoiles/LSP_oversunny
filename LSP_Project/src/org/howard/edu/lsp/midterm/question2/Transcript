✅ Transcript of AI Prompts and Responses (for Question 2)

User Prompt #1:
“I need to write an AreaCalculator class in Java that uses method overloading to calculate area for a circle, rectangle, triangle, and square. Each method should throw an exception if the dimension is less than or equal to zero. Can you show me how to implement this?”

AI Response #1:
Sure. You can use four overloaded static methods named area. One will accept a double for radius, one will accept two doubles for rectangle width and height, one will accept two ints for triangle base and height, and one will accept a single int for square side. Each method can validate input and then return the computed area. Here is an example:

public class AreaCalculator {
    public static double area(double radius) {
        if (radius <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("radius must be > 0");
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    public static double area(double width, double height) {
        if (width <= 0 || height <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("width/height must be > 0");
        return width * height;
    }

    public static double area(int base, int height) {
        if (base <= 0 || height <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("base/height must be > 0");
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }

    public static double area(int side) {
        if (side <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("side must be > 0");
        return side * side;
    }
}


User Prompt #2:
“I also need a Main class that prints the exact output listed in the assignment and demonstrates the exception being thrown. Can you write that part?”

AI Response #2:
Certainly. Below is a Main class that calls each overloaded method and prints the exact required lines. It also calls one method incorrectly to demonstrate an IllegalArgumentException inside a try/catch:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Circle radius 3.0 \u2192 area = " + AreaCalculator.area(3.0));
        System.out.println("Rectangle 5.0 x 2.0 \u2192 area = " + AreaCalculator.area(5.0, 2.0));
        System.out.println("Triangle base 10, height 6 \u2192 area = " + AreaCalculator.area(10, 6));
        System.out.println("Square side 4 \u2192 area = " + AreaCalculator.area(4));

        try {
            System.out.println(AreaCalculator.area(-1.0));
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}


User Prompt #3:
“Write a short explanation in a comment about why overloading is better than naming each method differently.”

AI Response #3:
You can place this comment inside the Main class:

/*
 * Overloading keeps the API cleaner by using one logical method name ("area")
 * for related behaviors. Using separate names like circleArea() or rectangleArea()
 * works, but it is less consistent and harder to organize compared to overloading.
