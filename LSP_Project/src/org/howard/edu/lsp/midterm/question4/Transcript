✅ Transcript of AI Prompts and Responses (for Question 4)

User Prompt #1:
“I need to complete a Java assignment where several smart-campus devices extend an abstract Device class and implement interfaces Networked and BatteryPowered. The devices are DoorLock, Thermostat, and Camera. Can you explain what I need to build?”

AI Response #1:
You must keep the provided Device class exactly as is. Then, you will create two interfaces: Networked (with connect, disconnect, and isConnected methods) and BatteryPowered (with battery getter and setter). After that, you will implement three concrete classes: DoorLock (extends Device and implements both interfaces), Thermostat (extends Device and implements Networked), and Camera (extends Device and implements both interfaces). Finally, you must run everything with the provided Main.java without changing it.

User Prompt #2:
“Okay, show me the correct Networked and BatteryPowered interfaces first.”

AI Response #2:

public interface Networked {
    void connect();
    void disconnect();
    boolean isConnected();
}

public interface BatteryPowered {
    int getBatteryPercent();
    void setBatteryPercent(int percent);
}


User Prompt #3:
“Now help me write the DoorLock class. It must call super in the constructor, implement both interfaces, validate the battery, and match the exact status format in the assignment.”

AI Response #3:

public class DoorLock extends Device implements Networked, BatteryPowered {
    private int batteryPercent;

    public DoorLock(String id, String location, int initialBattery) {
        super(id, location);
        setBatteryPercent(initialBattery);
    }

    @Override public void connect() { setConnected(true); }
    @Override public void disconnect() { setConnected(false); }
    @Override public boolean isConnected() { return super.isConnected(); }

    @Override public int getBatteryPercent() { return batteryPercent; }
    @Override public void setBatteryPercent(int percent) {
        if (percent < 0 || percent > 100) throw new IllegalArgumentException("battery 0..100");
        this.batteryPercent = percent;
    }

    @Override public String getStatus() {
        String connStatus = isConnected() ? "up" : "down";
        return "DoorLock[id=" + getId() + ", loc=" + getLocation() +
               ", conn=" + connStatus + ", batt=" + batteryPercent + "%]";
    }
}


User Prompt #4:
“Good. Now do the Thermostat class. It only needs the networking behavior, plus it should show the temperature in its status output.”

AI Response #4:

public class Thermostat extends Device implements Networked {
    private double temperatureC;

    public Thermostat(String id, String location, double initialTempC) {
        super(id, location);
        this.temperatureC = initialTempC;
    }

    public double getTemperatureC() { return temperatureC; }
    public void setTemperatureC(double temperatureC) { this.temperatureC = temperatureC; }

    @Override public void connect() { setConnected(true); }
    @Override public void disconnect() { setConnected(false); }
    @Override public boolean isConnected() { return super.isConnected(); }

    @Override public String getStatus() {
        String connStatus = isConnected() ? "up" : "down";
        return "Thermostat[id=" + getId() + ", loc=" + getLocation() +
               ", conn=" + connStatus + ", tempC=" + temperatureC + "]";
    }
}


User Prompt #5:
“Now finish the Camera class. It should work exactly like the DoorLock but with its own Camera status string.”

AI Response #5:

public class Camera extends Device implements Networked, BatteryPowered {
    private int batteryPercent;

    public Camera(String id, String location, int initialBattery) {
        super(id, location);
        setBatteryPercent(initialBattery);
    }

    @Override public void connect() { setConnected(true); }
    @Override public void disconnect() { setConnected(false); }
    @Override public boolean isConnected() { return super.isConnected(); }

    @Override public int getBatteryPercent() { return batteryPercent; }
    @Override public void setBatteryPercent(int percent) {
        if (percent < 0 || percent > 100) throw new IllegalArgumentException("battery 0..100");
        this.batteryPercent = percent;
    }

    @Override public String getStatus() {
        String connStatus = isConnected() ? "up" : "down";
        return "Camera[id=" + getId() + ", loc=" + getLocation() +
               ", conn=" + connStatus + ", batt=" + batteryPercent + "%]";
    }
}


User Prompt #6:
“Before I move on, please confirm that the Main file will run without any changes.”

AI Response #6:
Yes. If your folders and packages are correct and your classes implement the interfaces exactly, the provided Main.java will:

Catch an illegal battery exception

Show heartbeat timestamps

Show polymorphism through Device references

Show Networked and BatteryPowered interface polymorphism

Print status before and after calling connect()

User Prompt #7:
“I also need my rationale. Why is Device abstract, how do interfaces add behavior, and why is this not multiple inheritance?”

AI Response #7:
Because Device defines shared fields and functionality that all devices need, but leaves getStatus() to each subclass, it makes sense as an abstract base class. The interfaces Networked and BatteryPowered add optional behaviors that classes can implement, allowing the main program to treat objects polymorphically. This is not multiple inheritance because Java only allows one superclass; interfaces provide behavior contracts without inheriting implementation.
